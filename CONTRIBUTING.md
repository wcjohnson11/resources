To Do:

- Indicate which are code (i.e. a link to a repo) and which are books/articles/lists etc. Sometimes you're looking for code, sometimes you're just not.

- For repos, add the short description the author gave the repo.

- For articles, write a descriptive one liner.

- Figure out which categories should be combined, dropped, added.
